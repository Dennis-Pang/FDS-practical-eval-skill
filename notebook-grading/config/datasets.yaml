# Dataset Configuration
# Information about datasets used in this assignment

datasets:
  training:
    location: "/Users/dp/Desktop/TA agent/data/teacher/practical1"
    description: "Training datasets used by students in their notebooks"
    note: "Students load these datasets with various relative paths that need to be fixed"

  testing:
    file_path: "/Users/dp/Desktop/TA agent/data/teacher/practical1/df_test.pkl"
    format: "pickle"
    description: "Test dataset for evaluating Task 4 (Optional Advanced Task)"
    usage: "Students did NOT use this during training - graders must load and apply student's pipeline"
    load_command: "pd.read_pickle('/Users/dp/Desktop/TA agent/data/teacher/practical1/df_test.pkl')"

# Dataset path fixing requirements
path_fixing:
  required: true
  priority: "CRITICAL - must be done BEFORE executing any student code"
  steps:
    - "Search for dataset loading statements in student notebooks"
    - "Replace their paths with absolute paths to dataset location"
    - "Match dataset filenames exactly (case-sensitive)"
    - "DO NOT modify any other code"
