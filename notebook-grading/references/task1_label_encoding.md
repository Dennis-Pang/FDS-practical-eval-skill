# Task 1: Label Encoding

## Task Description

Students must encode categorical labels into numerical format for machine learning models.

## Requirements

- Properly encode labels using an appropriate encoding scheme
- Labels should be correctly transformed for use in classification models
- Encoding should be consistent throughout the notebook

## Error Keys

| Key | Points | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `1_task_1_ok` | 0 | Task solved correctly |
| `1_Wrong_or_Missing_Label_encoding` | 1 | Labels are not or wrongly encoded |

## What to Check

- [ ] Label encoding is implemented
- [ ] Encoding scheme is appropriate for the task
- [ ] Labels are correctly transformed
- [ ] Code executes without errors

## Common Issues

1. **Missing label encoding**: Student forgot to encode labels
2. **Wrong encoding scheme**: Used incorrect encoding method
3. **Inconsistent encoding**: Labels encoded differently in different parts

## Evaluation Notes

- Focus on whether the encoding logic is correct
- Don't require exact matching with reference solution
- Accept different encoding methods (LabelEncoder, manual mapping, etc.) as long as they work correctly
